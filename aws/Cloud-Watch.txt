CLOUD WATCH - AWS

CLOUD WATCH:
• It is used for various purposes like MONITORING, ALARMS, DASHBOARDS, LOGS AND SCALING
• It is used to monitor various AWS services.
• It allows us to record metrics for aws services like EC2, EBS, ELB AND Amazon S3. We can setup alarms for our EC2 Instances



PROJECT-1: CREATE ALARM FOR AN EC2-INSTANCE

HOW IT WORKS:
• Once we launch an instance if the CPU utilisation of instance is above 80% then alarm will be triggered
• Once alarm is triggered you will get notiﬁed by SNS service




1. Launch EC2 instance beacuse we are going to monitor upon EC2 only now.
2. Open Cloud Watch.
3. Alarms --> In alarm --> create alarm --> select metric --> EC2 --> Per-Instance metric --> search your ec2 by name and select the CPU utilization.
   Select CPU utilization --> Select metric
4. period --> 1minute
5. Whenever CPUUtilization is... Define the alarm condition.
   select Greater/Equal
   Define the threshold value = 10 --> next
6. Notification --> Send a notification to the following SNS topic --> Create new topic
7. Create a new topic… --> name --> 
8. Email endpoints that will receive the notification… --> ayushraj387@gmail.com --> create topic --> next
9. Alarm name--> abc --> next --> create alarm
10. you will a mail subscribe it to the notification.
11. connect your server.
12. provide the stress:- 
    sudo yum install stress -y
    stress --cpu 4 
13. now you can monitor your ec2 and as soon as stress increses you will get an mail.
