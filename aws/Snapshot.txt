What is SnapShot:
• EBS Snapshots are copies of your EBS Volumes.
• We can create up to 5000 EBS Volumes in a single account. We can create up to 10000 EBS snapshots in a single account.
• Snapshots can be stored on S3 (not ours) but can only be accessed through EC2 API'S.
• Snapshots will be Region Specific.
• While taking snapshot we need to stop server.
• If Data is added to server while taking snapshot it wont be written Once snapshot is created Copy it to other region.
• We can restore snapshot even if we delete them.
• we can store snapshots in Archive for saving up to 75%.

PROCESS:
1. create a server on server-a and Deploy the App
2. create snapshot from server-a
3. create ebs volume from snapshot
4. stop server-b and remove existing volume
5. add the ebs volume created from snapshot and start server

EBS Snapshot Archive:
• Move a Snapshot to Archive for 75% cheaper.
• Takes within 24 to 72 hours for restoring the archive.
• Recycle Bin for EBS Snapshots:
• Setup rules to retain deleted snapshots so you can recover them after an accidental deletion
• Specify retention (from 1 day to 1 year).
• Fast Snapshot Restore (FSR):
• Force full Initialization of snapshot to have no latency on the first use ($$$).


1. create EC2
2. create snapshot:
   EC2 instance --> volumes --> i'd --> create snapshot 
3. select snapshot --> actions --> copy snapshot --> select the region which you want to copy 
4. copy snapshot
5. open new region
6. create volume from snapshot
7. create instance from snapshot
8. stop instance --> remove default volume --> attach your volume --> start instance --> open your public ip



RESTORING SNAPSHOTS:
RECYCLE BIN -- > RETENTION RULES -- > NAME: ABC -- > Resource type: EBS SNAPSHOTS -- > Apply to all resources -- > CREATE

note:
we can also do migratation with the use of AMI. And there are 6-7 ways of migratation of servers.
