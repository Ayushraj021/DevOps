What is AMI:
• An Amazon Machine Image (AMI) is an Template that provides the software that is required to set up and boot an Amazon EC2 Instance. Each AMI also contains a block device.
• You must specify an AMI when you launch an instance.
• The AMI must be compatible with the instance type.
• We can create our own AMI or use Public AMI.
• We can sell our AMI on AWS Market Place.
