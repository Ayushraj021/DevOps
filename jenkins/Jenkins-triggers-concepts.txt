CRON JOB: We can schedule the jobs that need to be run at particular intervals.
here we use cron syntax
cron syntax has * * * * *
each * is separated by space

*    : minutes
*    : hours
*    : date
*    : month
*    : day of week (sun=0, mon=1 ----)

10:30 pm 4 aug sun
21 9 3 8 6
create a ci job -- > Build Triggers -- > Build periodically -- > * * * * * -- > save

CRONTAB-GENERATOR: https://crontab.guru/

limitation: it will not check the code is changed or not.

http://54.159.60.215:8080/


POLL SCM:
in pollscm we will set time limit for the jobs.
if dev commit the code it will wait until the time is done.
in given time if we have any changes on code it will generate a build

create a ci job -- > Build Triggers -- > poll scm -- > * * * * * -- > save
commit the changes in GitHub then wait for 1 min.

LIMITATION:
1. in pollscm, we need to wait for the time we set.
2. we will get the last commit only.

WEBHOOK: it will trigger build the moment we change the code.
here we need not to wait for the build.

repo -- > settings -- > webhooks -- > add webhook -- > Payload URL (jenkins url) -- > http://35.180.46.134:8080/github-webhook/  -- > Content type -- > application/json -- > add

create ci job -- > Build Triggers: GitHub hook trigger for GITScm polling -- > save


BUILD SCRIPTS: to make jenkins builds from remote loc using script/
give token
give url on other browser.

THROTTLE BUILD:

To restrict the builds in a certain time or intervals.
if we dont restrict due to immediate builds jenkins might crashdown.

by default jenkins will not do concurrent builds.
we need to enable this option in configuration.

Execute concurrent builds if necessary -- > tick it

create a ci job -- > configure -- > Throttle builds -- > Number of builds: 3 -- > time period : hours -- > save

now it will take 20 minutes of gap for each build.



BUILD EXECUTORS & PARALLEL BUILDS:
Jenkins will run the jobs sequentially (one by one)
if i want to run multiple builds at same time we can configure like this

job -- > configure -- > Execute concurrent builds if necessary -- > save -- > build now 2 times
now we can see 2 jobs will be running on same time.

BUILD EXECUTORS: max number of builds we can run
build-executor status -- > Built-In Node -- > Configure -- > 2 - 5 -- >save
now build 5 times


WHEN WE STOP SERVER:
1. IP WILL CHANGE
2. SERVICES WILL BE STOPPED

chkconfig jenkins on: to start the service automatically whenever we restart it.
