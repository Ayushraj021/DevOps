SETUP: Create an EC2 and Include all traffic in sg

#STEP-1: INSTALLING GIT JAVA-1.8.0 MAVEN
yum install git java-1.8.0-openjdk maven -y

#STEP-2: GETTING THE REPO (jenkins.io --> download -- > redhat)
sudo wget -O /etc/yum.repos.d/jenkins.repo https://pkg.jenkins.io/redhat-stable/jenkins.repo
sudo rpm --import https://pkg.jenkins.io/redhat-stable/jenkins.io-2023.key

#STEP-3: DOWNLOAD JAVA11 AND JENKINS
amazon-linux-extras install java-openjdk11 -y
yum install jenkins -y
update-alternatives --config java

#STEP-4: START JENKINS (when we download service it will on stopped state)
systemctl start jenkins.service
systemctl status jenkins.service

CONNECT:
copy-public-ip:8080 (browser)
cat /var/lib/jenkins/secrets/initialAdminPassword (server)
paster password on browser -- > installing plugins --- > user details -- > start


JOB: it is used to perform task.
to do any work or task in jenkins we need to create a job.

to run commands we need to select execute shell on build steps.

build now: to run job
workspace: place where our job outputs will store

CREATING A JOB:
NEW ITEM -- > NAME: ci-job -- > FREESTYLE -- > OK -- > SCM -- > GIT -- > REPOURL: https://github.com/devopsbyraham/jenkins-java-project.git -- >Build Steps -- > ADD Build Steps -- > Execute shell -- > mvn clean package -- > save -- > build now

WORKSPACE: where your job output is going to be stored
Default: /var/lib/jenkins/workspace

CUSTOME WORKSPACE: Storing the jobs output on our own folders 
cd 
mkdir ayush
cd /
chown jenkins:jenkins /root
chown jenkins:jenkins /root/ayush
Go to the jenkins dashboard 
go to your job --> configure --> general --> advanced --> Use custom workspace --> /root/ayush --> save
