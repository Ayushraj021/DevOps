TYPES OF VARIABLES IN JENKINS:
1. USER DEFINED
2. JENKINS ENV

1. USER DEFINED VARIABLES: these are defined by user

a. Local Variable: Variable will work inside of job.
will be working for only single job.

NEW ITEM -- > NAME: ABC -- > FREESTYLE -- > OK -- > BUILD -- >EXECUTE SHELL

name=raham
echo "hai all my name is $name, $name is from hyderabad, $name is teaching devops"

WITH PARAMETERS:
take branch as variable

passing parameters:
configure -- > this project is parameterized -- > choice -- > name: branch values: main, master --
build with parameters.

b. Global Variable: Variable will work outside of job.
will be working for multiple job.


Dashboard -- > Manage Jenkins -- > System -- > Global properties  -- > Environment variables -- > add : Name: name value: raham -- > save

NOTE: while defining variables spaces will not be given.
local variables will be high priority.

Limitation: some values cant be defined by user because these values will change build by build.
ex: build number, time, name, url -----

2. JENKINS ENV VARIABLES: these are defined by Jenkins itself.
a. these variables can be change from build to build.
b. these variables will be on upper case.
c. these variables can be defined only once.

echo "the build number is $BUILD_NUMBER, the job name is $JOB_NAME"

printenv: gives all env vars of jenkins



find / -name jenkins.service
find command used to find the path of a file.

when we modify any file from system folder we need to reload daemon


ADMIN TASKS:
1. CHANGING PORT NUMBER OF JENKINS:

vim /usr/lib/systemd/system/jenkins.service
line-70: 8080=8090 -- > save and exit
systemctl daemon-reload
systemctl restart jenkins.service

When we change configuration of any service we need to restart.
